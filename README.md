# docker-fedora-latex

This Dockerfile sets up a TeXlive installation on basis of Fedora.

Fedora's DNF package manager per default includes all required dependencies (i.e. no need to manually specify JRE for arara to work, â€¦)

Furthermore, Python tools pip and virtualenv are included for enhanced processing.
